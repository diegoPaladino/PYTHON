# StepMotorPicoControl

## Introduction
StepMotorPicoControl is a Python-based project designed for controlling stepper motors using the Raspberry Pi Pico. This project enables precise movement control of two stepper motors, suitable for various robotic and automation applications.

## List of Necessary Materials
- 2 Stepper Motors
- 2 DVR8825 Motor Drivers
- Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires
- Power Supply for Motors

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a simple yet effective way to control stepper motors for automation tasks. It's particularly useful for hobbyists and engineers working on DIY projects that require precise motor control.

## Pros and Cons
**Pros:**
- Precise control over motor movement
- Scalable for various applications
- Easy to integrate and modify

**Cons:**
- Limited to the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Pico
- Requires external power source for motors

## General Guidelines
1. Connect the stepper motors to the DVR8825 drivers.
2. Connect the drivers to the Raspberry Pi Pico according to the defined pins in the script.
3. Ensure a suitable power supply for the motors.
4. Upload the Python script to the Raspberry Pi Pico.
5. Execute the script to control the motors.
