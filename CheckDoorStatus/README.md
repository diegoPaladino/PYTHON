# Door Status Checker

## Introduction
This simple Python script checks whether a door is closed based on user input. It's intended for educational purposes or to integrate with more complex systems that require door status monitoring.

## Installation
No installation is necessary beyond having Python installed on your system. This script was developed using Python 3.8 and should work on any later versions.

## Necessary Materials
- Python interpreter (version 3.8 or later recommended)

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate basic Python scripting skills and to provide a foundation for more complex projects involving physical or simulated door status checking.

## Pros and Cons
**Pros:**
- Simple to understand and use.
- Easily extendable for more complex applications.

**Cons:**
- Relies solely on user input; does not interface with actual hardware.

## General Guidelines
1. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
2. Answer the prompt with 'yes' or 'no' when asked if the door is closed.
3. Observe the output, which will indicate whether the door is closed or open based on your input.
