# HDHealthMonitor

## Introduction
HDHealthMonitor is a Python project designed to monitor and log the daily usage of hard drive storage, facilitating long-term storage management and analysis.

## List of Necessary Materials
- A computer with Python installed
- Hard drive to monitor

## Project Purpose
This tool aims to help users track how their storage usage changes over time, identifying trends and making informed decisions about data management, archiving, and cleanup.

## Pros and Cons
**Pros:**
- Automated daily logging of HD usage
- Simple setup and execution
- Data stored in an easily analyzable CSV format

**Cons:**
- Limited to monitoring a single partition or volume at a time
- Does not provide real-time monitoring or alerts

## General Guidelines
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Place the `HDHealthMonitor.py` script in a convenient location.
3. Schedule the script to run daily using your system's task scheduler (e.g., cron on Linux/macOS or Task Scheduler on Windows).
4. Review the `hd_usage_log.csv` file periodically for insights.
