# Student Name Identifier

## Introduction
This project aims to use machine learning to identify the name of a student in a school transcript image.

## Materials Needed
- Python
- OpenCV
- Pytesseract

## Purpose of the Project
The project uses image processing techniques to extract text from a school transcript image and identify the student's name. It can be useful for automating data extraction tasks in educational institutions.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Automates the process of extracting student names from school transcripts.
- Can be integrated into existing systems for data processing.

### Cons
- Requires a high-quality image for accurate text extraction.
- May require additional preprocessing steps for noisy or distorted images.

## General Guidelines
1. Install Python and required libraries.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Run the `student_name_identifier.py` script with a school transcript image as input.
