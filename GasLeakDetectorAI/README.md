# GasLeakDetectorAI

## Introduction
GasLeakDetectorAI is a highly efficient gas leak detection system designed for smart homes with integrated AI technology. It continuously monitors gas levels and triggers an alarm if a leak is detected.

## Necessary Materials
- Raspberry Pi or any compatible microcontroller
- Gas sensor (e.g., MQ-2)
- Buzzer or alarm system
- Python 3.x installed on the microcontroller
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## Project Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to enhance home safety by providing real-time gas leak detection. It is designed to alert homeowners immediately upon detecting dangerous gas levels, thereby preventing potential accidents and ensuring a safer living environment.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros
- Real-time monitoring of gas levels.
- Immediate alert system to prevent accidents.
- Easy integration with existing smart home systems.
- Scalable and customizable for different types of gas sensors.

### Cons
- Requires hardware components and setup.
- Dependent on sensor accuracy and placement.

## General Guidelines

### Installation
1. Install Python 3.x on your microcontroller.
2. Connect the gas sensor and alarm to the microcontroller as per the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GasLeakDetectorAI.git
    ```
4. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd GasLeakDetectorAI
    ```
5. Run the detector script:
    ```bash
    python gas_leak_detector.py
    ```

### Usage
- Ensure the gas sensor is properly placed in areas prone to gas leaks.
- Regularly test the system by exposing the sensor to small amounts of gas and verifying the alarm trigger.

### Troubleshooting
- If the alarm does not trigger, check the sensor connections and threshold level.
- Ensure the microcontroller has the necessary permissions to access GPIO pins.
