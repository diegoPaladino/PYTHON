# SmartIrrigationSystem

## Introduction
The Smart Irrigation System is an automated solution designed to maintain optimal soil moisture levels for plants. It utilizes a moisture sensor to monitor soil conditions and automatically activates a water pump when the moisture level falls below a set threshold.

## Necessary Materials
- Raspberry Pi
- Moisture sensor
- Water pump
- Relay module
- Connecting wires
- Power supply

## Project Purpose
This project aims to automate the process of watering plants, ensuring they receive the right amount of water even when you are not around. It is particularly useful for gardeners, farmers, and plant enthusiasts who want to maintain healthy plant growth with minimal manual effort.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros
- Automated watering saves time and effort
- Prevents overwatering and underwatering
- Easy to set up and use

### Cons
- Requires initial setup and calibration
- Dependent on power supply
- Limited to the range of the moisture sensor

## General Guidelines

### Installation
1. Connect the moisture sensor to the Raspberry Pi.
2. Connect the water pump to the relay module.
3. Wire the relay module to the Raspberry Pi.
4. Ensure all connections are secure and power up the Raspberry Pi.

### Usage
1. Set the desired moisture threshold in the code.
2. Run the `SmartIrrigationSystem` script.
3. Monitor the system's output to ensure it is functioning correctly.

### Troubleshooting
- Check all connections if the pump does not activate.
- Verify the moisture sensor readings for accuracy.
- Ensure the Raspberry Pi has a stable power supply.
