# VehicleGpsTrackingSystem

## Introduction
The `VehicleGpsTrackingSystem` is a Python-based application designed to track vehicles' locations using GPS data. It fetches the location data from a specified tracking URL and updates the vehicles' positions in real-time.

## List of Necessary Materials
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (install using `pip install requests`)
- An API endpoint that provides vehicle location data

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a simple yet effective way to track multiple vehicles' locations using GPS data. It can be beneficial for fleet management, logistics, and any application requiring real-time vehicle tracking.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Simple and easy to set up
- Real-time tracking of multiple vehicles
- Extendable for various applications

### Cons
- Depends on the availability and reliability of the GPS tracking API
- Basic implementation without advanced features like geofencing or alerts

## General Guidelines
### Setup
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install the `requests` library by running:
   ```sh
   pip install requests
