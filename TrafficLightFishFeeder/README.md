# TrafficLightFishFeeder

## Introduction
This project implements a traffic light controller for a 2-lane avenue and an automated fish feeder for tilapia aquaculture, using LoRA for communication.

## List of Materials Needed
- Raspberry Pi
- LoRA module
- Traffic light signals
- Fish feeder mechanism

## Purpose of the Project
The project aims to provide a solution for managing traffic flow and automating fish feeding in a tilapia aquaculture setup, improving efficiency and reducing manual labor.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Efficient traffic management
- Automated fish feeding at optimal times

### Cons
- Requires setup and maintenance of hardware components
- Relies on accurate timekeeping for feeding schedule

## General Guidelines
1. Install Python on Raspberry Pi.
2. Connect LoRA module to Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.
3. Configure traffic light signals and fish feeder mechanism.
4. Run the Python script to control the traffic lights and automate fish feeding.
