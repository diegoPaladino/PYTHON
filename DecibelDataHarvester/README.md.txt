# DecibelDataHarvester

## Introduction
The DecibelDataHarvester is a Python-based project developed for Raspberry Pi. It aims to measure environmental decibel levels over a 24-hour period, storing the data in a CSV file for robust data analysis.

## List of Necessary Materials
- Raspberry Pi 2 Model B V1.1
- KY-037 Microphone Module or a simple microphone
- Python 3.x with packages: sounddevice, numpy, pandas

## Project Purpose
This project provides a reliable and straightforward way to continuously monitor sound levels. It is ideal for researchers, environmentalists, or anyone interested in studying ambient noise patterns.

## Pros and Cons
**Pros:**
- Continuous 24-hour monitoring
- Easy to set up and use
- Precise decibel recording

**Cons:**
- Limited to environments suitable for Raspberry Pi
- Requires external power source for long-term use

## General Guidelines
1. Install necessary Python packages: `sounddevice`, `numpy`, `pandas`.
2. Connect the microphone module to the Raspberry Pi.
3. Run the provided Python script.
4. The data will be saved in a CSV file for analysis.
