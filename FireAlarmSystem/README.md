# FireAlarmSystem

## Introduction
The FireAlarmSystem is a Python-based project designed to simulate a basic fire alarm system that monitors temperature levels and triggers an alarm when the temperature exceeds a specified threshold.

## List of Necessary Materials
- Python 3.x installed on your machine
- `random` and `time` modules (both are included in the Python Standard Library)

## Project Purpose
This project aims to provide a simple simulation of a fire alarm system using Python. It reads simulated temperature data, checks if the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold, and triggers an alarm if necessary. This can be useful for educational purposes, prototype development, or as a foundation for a more complex fire alarm system.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Simple and easy to understand
- Provides a basic structure for a fire alarm system
- Can be extended with more complex features

### Cons
- Uses simulated data rather than real sensor input
- Lacks integration with actual hardware components
- Basic functionality without advanced features like logging or notifications

## General Guidelines
### Installation
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository or download the source code.

### Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code.
3. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python fire_alarm_system.py
